## Getting started

### Environment 🌍

To save the environment, we use Conda. Simply create and activate the environment in the following way:

```
conda env create -f conda.yaml
conda env activate hmm
```

### Dependencies

We use Poetry (v1.3.1) to handle dependencies within the environment. Simply install dependencies like this:

```
python -m poetry install
```

You can use your own Poetry if you feel like it. No worries.
